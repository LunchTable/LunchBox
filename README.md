LunchBox
========

This project provides a foundation for using [LunchTable](http://www.lunch-table.com/) data in a useful way.

## How it works

LunchTable believes in data portability and, ultimately, _you_ owning the data you've given us-- even if it's stored on _our_ servers somewhere on the internet.
You should feel free to create something great with LunchTable, knowing you can take your creations anywhere you desire, at your whim.

**LunchBox** provides a starting point for this by supplying example projects that utilize LunchTable data and intend to get you thinking about possiblities.

### Exporting data

1. Navigate to http://www.lunch-table.com/export.php
2. If not already, log in to your account
3. Click the **Data** link after selecting the options you want
4. From your browser, **Save** the file that comes up

## Road map

* Exporting media (images, audio, video)
* Exporting interactions received (heart, yay, nay)
* A self-contained web page for viewing LunchTable data
