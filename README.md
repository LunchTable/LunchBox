LunchBox
========

This project provides a foundation for using [LunchTable](https://www.lunch-table.com/) data in a useful way.

## How it works

LunchTable believes in data portability and, ultimately, _you_ owning the data you've given us-- even if it's stored on _our_ servers somewhere on the internet.
You should feel free to create something great with LunchTable, knowing you can take your creations anywhere you desire, at your whim.

**LunchBox** aims to provide example projects that utilize LunchTable data and intends to get you thinking about possiblities. As more data becomes exportable, more will be possible for LunchBox, too.

### Exporting data

1. Navigate to https://www.lunch-table.com/export.php
2. (If not already, log in to your account)
3. Click the **Get Data** link after selecting the options you want
4. From your browser, **Save** the file that comes up

## Road map

* Exporting media (images, audio, video)
* Exporting interactions received (heart, yay, nay)
* A self-contained web page for viewing LunchTable data
